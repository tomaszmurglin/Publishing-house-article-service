DDD business model example:

Background
There is a publishing house, which publishes the "Layer Weekly" magazine. The management of the publishing house all of a sudden decided to switch their employees to fully remote positions. In the process of establishing how the company would handle it, the management came up with a solution to exchange articles by e-mail. Unfortunately, the process was long and error-prone, so the Editor in Chief decided that they need a collaboration tool to ease the process of drafting and publishing articles. "IT to the rescue"! â€” our story begins here.
